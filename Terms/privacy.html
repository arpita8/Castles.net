This information includes the: (a) name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; (b) browser software you use and your operating system; and (c) Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to this website. We will use information that we automatically collect to manage and improve our website to make it as useful as possible for visitors like you.

For example, if you choose to complete and submit one of the forms located on our website to inquire on a listing, send a message to an agent, submit an agent or company testimonial, order products, register to receive information, or join the Castles Real Estate Network, we will retain the information you submit to respond to your inquiry, consider your request or fill your order.

You may request to review the information we retain at any time, or request that we delete it at any time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Castles.net will not sell or rent the personal information you provide to us to any third party without first obtaining your consent. In addition, we will not disclose the personal information you provide to us without your consent, except: (a) as required by law, (b) to our independent contractors who host and maintain our website and email services; (c) to service providers or suppliers if the disclosure will enable that party to perform business, professional or technical support for us.</span></p>
