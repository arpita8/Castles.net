There are three bedrooms in the villa\'s main house, two in the guest cottage and one in the poolside cottage. In the main house, all three bedrooms have king beds and en-suite bathrooms and two have balconies as well. In the guest cottage, the two bedrooms have a king bed and queen bed, respectively, and share a bathroom. The poolside cottage\'s bedroom has a queen bed. Not only are the villa\'s rooms air-conditioned, they have breezy, European-influenced decor. The open-plan living area is covered by a whitewashed cathedral ceiling and has plenty of plump white sofas and wicker chairs, but is grounded by exotic pieces like Persian rugs and Chinese-style chests.
