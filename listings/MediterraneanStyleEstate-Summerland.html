Designed by Don Nulty, AIA, this impeccable property is superbly constructed with materials hand-selected, custom-made and personally imported from France, Italy and elsewhere in Europe. \n\nThrough double gates, up a private drive flanked by stately trees and manicured grounds, a grand motor court sets a tone of gracious elegance, and the entrance galleria has soaring arches that welcome guests with classic proportions and tranquil warmth. Within, this five ensuite-bedroom residence combines strength and spaciousness with gem-like beauty. Every material, fitting and detail was chosen and placed to accommodate the most cordial - and comfortable - lifestyle. \n\nBuilt on a scale to offer both intimacy and expansive entertaining, life at Tuscany Oaks takes in sublime views stretching from the Santa Ynez Mountains to the Channel Islands, and from Santa Barbara to Port Hueneme. This is an estate that celebrates the equestrian life, whether it takes the form of thoroughbreds, polo ponies, dressage or casual trail riding along the nearby beach and bluffs. The 18-stall barn includes an office, tack room and two-bedroom ranch manager\'s apartment.
